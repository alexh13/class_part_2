# class_part_2
Continuing from my classes intro assignment, this one builds on that and introduces multiple files.

What I Learned:
- Define syntactically correct constructors in classes in accordance with good programming practice
- Divide a project into 3 files: specification file, implementation file, and client program file
- Use the const keyword correctly
